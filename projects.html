                <strong>1) Sun tracking solar panel system (February 2020) - </strong>
                The main objective of the project was to improve the efficiency of the 
                solar panels used in various fields and sectors. Arduino was used to code for the 
                programming.

                <strong>2) Solar powered smart irrigation system (May 2020) - </strong>
                The project was aimed to give a solution to the problems faced by farmers due to
                the scarcity of water and electricity. The system was developed with the help of sensors such that, it supplies
                water to the fields only when it is required to. In addition to this, it had a pest detection and crop heath detection.
                The coding for this was done with the help of Arduino Programming and Open CV, maching learning.
